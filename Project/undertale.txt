* whoops.
* i knew i should have
  used today's crossword
  instead.
* what? really, dude?
* that easy-peasy word
  scramble?
* that's for baby bones.
* i've been thinking
  about selling treats
  too.
  
* you're right.
* i should charge way
  more than than that.
* that's still too low.
* i have to pay for
  the raw materials
  somehow.
* what?
* you don't have the
  money?
* hey, that's okay.
* i don't have any snow.
* wow, that's a lot
  of cash.
* that's why i'm sorry
  to say...
* i can't sell you
  this fried snow.
* it's got too much
  sentimental value.
* don't you know a
  good deal when you
  hear one?
* i'm thinking about
  getting into the
  telescope business.
* it's normally 50000G
  to use this premium
  telescope...
* but...
* since i know you,
  you can use it for free.
* howzabout it?
* huh?
* you aren't satisfied?
* don't worry.
* i'll give you a
  full refund.
* well, come back
  whenever you want.
* what?
* haven't you seen a guy
  with two jobs before?
* fortunately, two jobs
  means twice as many
  legally-required breaks.
* ...
* hey, looks like you're
  really turning yourself
  around.
* how about i treat you
  to lunch at grillby's?
* ... when everyone you
  scared away comes
  back, i mean.
* well, if you insist...
* i'll pry myself away
  from my work...
* OK. have fun.
* whoops, watch where
  you sit down.
* sometimes weirdos put
  whoopee cushions on
  the seats.
* anyway, let's order.
* ok, coming right up.
* hey, that sounds
  pretty good.
* grillby, we'll have
  a double order of
  fries.
* grillby, we'll have
  a double order of
  burg.
* so, what do you
  think...
* of course he's cool.
* you'd be cool too
  if you wore that
  outfit every day.
* he'd only take that
  thing off if he
  absolutely had to.
* oh well.
* at least he washes
  it.
* and by that i mean
  he wears it in
  the shower.
* hey, pal.
* sarcasm isn't funny,
  okay?
* my brother's a real
  star.
* he's the person who
  pushed me to get
  this sentry job.
* maybe it's a little
  strange, but
  sometimes...
* ... it's nice to have
  someone call you out
  on being lazy.
* even though nothing
  could be further
  from the truth.
* here comes the grub.
* bone appetit.
* more for me.
* so you know all
  about it.
* i'll tell you, then.
* the echo flower.
* they're all over the
  marsh.
* say something to them,
  and they'll repeat it
  over and over...
* what about it?
* well, papyrus told
  me something interesting
  the other day.
* sometimes, when no
  one else is around...
* a flower appears and
  whispers things to
  him.
* flattery...
* advice...
* encouragement...
* ... predictions.
* weird, huh?
* someone must be using
  an echo flower to
  play a trick on him.
* keep an eye out, ok?
* thanks.
* oh, by the way...
* i'm flat broke.
* can you foot the
  bill?
* hey buddy, what's up?
* wanna buy a hot dog?
* here.
* have fun.
* here's another hot
  dog.
* it's on the house.
* well, no.
* it's on you.
* sorry, thirty is
  the limit on
  head-dogs.
* i'll be 'frank' with
  you.
* as much as i like
  putting hot dogs
  on your head...
* thirty is just
  an excessive number.
* twenty-nine, now
  that's fine, but
  thirty...
* does it look like
  my arms can reach
  that high?
* thanks, kid.
* here's your hot dog.
* thanks, kid.
* here's your 'dog.
* yeah. 'dog.
* apostrophe-dog.
* it's short for hot-dog.
* another h'dog?
* here you go...
* whoops, i'm actually
  out of hot dogs.
* here, you can have
  a hot cat instead.
* another dog, coming
  right up...
* ... you really like
  hot animals, don't
  you?
* hey, i'm not judging.
* i'd be out of a job
  without folks like you.
* cool.
* here's that ''dog.
* apostrophe-apostrophe
  dog.
* it's short for
  apostrophe-dog.
* which is, in turn,
  short for...
* another one?
* okay.
* careful.
* if you eat
  too many hot dogs...
* you'll probably get
  huge like me.
* huge as in super-
  popular, i mean.
* i'm practically
  a hot-dog tycoon now.
* whoops, you don't have
  enough cash.
* you should get a job.
* i've heard being a
  sentry pays well.
* you're holding too much.
* ... guess i'll just put
  it on your head.
* yeah, you've gotta
  save your money for
  college and spiders.
* hey.
* i heard you're going
  to the core.
* great, thanks for
  treating me.
* well, have fun in
  there.
* guess i have to
  go in the trash
  too.
* we call that
  "the sun," my friend.
* though...
* one thing about you
  always struck me
  as kinda odd.
* now, i understand
  acting in self-defense.
* you were thrown into
  those situations
  against your will.
* but...
* sometimes...
* you act like you
  know what's gonna
  happen.
* like you've already
  experienced it all
  before.
* this is an odd thing
  to say, but...
* if you have some sort
  of special power...
* isn't it your
  responsibility to do
  the right thing?
* ah.
* i see.
* ...
* heh.
* well, that's your
  viewpoint.
* i won't judge you
  for it.
nope.
* that's called snow.
* me too.
   
huh.
always wondered why
people never use
their strongest
attack first.
anyway, as i was
saying, it's a
nice day out.
why not relax and
take a load off?
here we go.
huff... puff...
all right.
that's it.
it's time for my 
special attack.
are you ready?
here goes nothing.
yep.
that's right.
it's literally
nothing.
and it's not gonna
be anything,
either.
heh heh heh...
ya get it?
i know i can't
beat you.
one of your turns...
you're just gonna
kill me.
so, uh.
i've decided...
it's not gonna BE
your turn.
ever.
i'm just gonna
keep having MY
turn until you
give up.
even if it means
we have to stand
here until the
end of time.
capiche?
you'll get bored
here.
if you haven't
gotten bored
already, i mean.
and then, you'll
finally quit.
i know your type.
you're, uh, very
determined, aren't
you?
you'll never give
up, even if
there's, uh...
absolutely NO
benefit to
persevering
whatsoever.
if i can make
that clear.
no matter what,
you'll just keep
going.
not out of any
desire for good
or evil...
but just because
you think you
can.
and because you
"can"...
... you "have to."
but now, you've
reached the end.
there is nothing
left for you now.
so, uh, in my
personal opinion...
the most
"determined"
thing you can
do here?
is to, uh,
completely give
up.
and... (yawn)
do literally
anything else.
heh, didja
really think you
would be able to
so...
guess that's it,
huh?
just...
don't say i
didn't warn you.
welp.
i'm going to
grillby's.
papyrus, do you
want anything?
what?
you think i'm just
gonna stand there
and take it?
our reports showed
a massive anomaly
in the timespace
continuum.
timelines jumping
left and right,
stopping and
starting...
until suddenly,
everything ends.
heh heh heh...
that's your fault,
isn't it?
you can't understand
how this feels.
knowing that one
day, without any
warning...
it's all going to
be reset.
look.
i gave up trying
to go back a long
time ago.
and getting to the
surface doesn't
really appeal
anymore, either.
cause even if we
do...
we'll just end up
right back here,
without any memory
of it, right?
to be blunt...
it makes it kind
of hard to give
it my all.
... or is that just
a poor excuse for
being lazy...?
hell if i know.
all i know is...
seeing what comes
next...
i can't afford not
to care anymore.
ugh...
that being said...
you, uh, really
like swinging that
thing around,
huh?
listen.
i know you didn't
answer me before,
but...
somewhere in
there.
i can feel it.
there's a glimmer
of a good person
inside of you.
the memory of
someone who once
wanted to do the
right thing.
someone who, in
another time,
might have even
been...
a friend?
c'mon, buddy.
do you remember
me?
please, if you're
listening...
let's forget all
this, ok?
just lay down
your weapon, and...
well, my job
will be a lot
easier.
friendship...
it's really great,
right?
let's quit fighting.
welp, it was
worth a shot.
guess you like
doing things the
hard way, huh?
woah, you look
REALLY pissed off...
heheheh...
did i getcha?
well, if you came
back anyway...
i guess that means
we never really
WERE friends, huh?
heh.
don't tell that
to the other
sans-es, ok?
sounds strange, but
before all this i
was secretly hoping
we could be friends.
i always thought the
anomaly was doing
this cause they
were unhappy.
and when they got
what they wanted,
they would stop
all this.
and maybe all they
needed was...
i dunno.
some good food,
some bad laughs,
some nice friends.
but that's
ridiculous,
right?
yeah, you're the
type of person
who won't EVER
be happy.
you'll keep
consuming timelines
over and over,
until...
well.
hey.
take it from me,
kid.
someday...
you gotta learn
when to QUIT.
and that day's
TODAY.
cause...
y'see..
all this fighting
is really tiring
me out.
and if you keep
pushing me...
then i'll be
forced to use my 
special attack.
yeah, my special
attack.
sound familiar?
well, get ready.
cause after the
next move, i'm
going to use it.
so, if you don't
wanna see it, now
would be a good
time to die.
well, here goes
nothing...
survive THIS, and
i'll show you my 
special attack!
you're sparing me?
finally.
buddy.
pal.
i know how hard
it must be...
to make that
choice.
to go back on
everything you've
worked up to.
i want you to
know...
i won't let it
go to waste.
...
c'mere, pal.
it's a beautiful
day outside.
birds are singing,
flowers are
blooming...
on days like these,
kids like you...
birds are singing,
ready?
Should
be
burning
in hell.
nah, i'm rootin for
ya, kid.                                 
just
give
up.
i did.
why
even
try?
you'll
never
see 'em
again.
  geeettttttt
  dunked on!!!
  if we're really
  friends...
  you won't come back.
* hey there.
* this is just a little test.
    
* no. not today.
* actually, hey...
* hate to bother ya, but
  can you do me a favor?
* i was thinking...
* my brother's been
  kind of down lately...
* he's never seen a human
  before. and seeing you
  might just make his day.
* don't worry, he's not
  dangerous.
* even if he tries to be.
* thanks a million.
* i'll be up ahead.
* well, i'll be straight-
  forward with you.
* my brother'd really
  like to see a human...
* so, y'know, it'd
  really help me out...
* if you kept pretending
  to be one.
* don't you only have
  one outfit?
* oh. right.
* good idea.
* say, why don't you
  look over there?
* behold.
* uhhhh...
* actually, i think that's
  a rock.
* uhhhh...
* i think it looks
  familiar...
* because it's a rock?
* hey, what's that in
  front of the rock?
(yes)
* well.
* it's not a rock.
* well, that went well.
* don't sweat it, kid.
* i'll keep an eyesocket
  out for ya.
* ... and you don't even
  bat an eye, huh?
* i think that's called...
* sleeping.
* do you not know...
* who you know?
* i think the human
  has to hold the orb.
* it's right there.
* on the ground.
* trust me.
* there's no way they can
  get past this one.
* trust me.
* there's no way they'll
  skip this one.
* i'm tellin' ya.
* everyone likes word
  searches.
* knew i should have
  put down junior jumble
  instead.
* well, maybe they
  don't like japes.
* what about undyne?
* doesn't she hate
  puzzles?
* that makes sense.
* well?
* what's the holdup?
* that, uh, doesn't look
  very activated.
* hmmm...
* so this human thing
  was a bust, huh?
* without traps and fire?
* me?
* right about something?
* really?
* heheh... the old whoopee
  cushion in the hand
  trick.
* it's ALWAYS funny.
* anyways,
  you're a human, right?
* that's hilarious.
* heh, the old whoopee
  cushion in the hand
  trick...
* wait a sec...
* have you heard it before
  or something?
* you turned around before
  i said to...
* ... weird.
* ... whatever.
* you're a human, right?
* i'm sans.
* sans the skeleton.
* im actually supposed to
  be on watch for
  humans right now.
* but... y'know...
* i dont really care about
  capturing anybody.
* now my brother,
  papyrus...
* he's a human-hunting
  FANATIC.
* hey, actually, I think
  that's him over there.
* i have an idea.
* go through this gate
  thingy.
* yeah, go right through.
* my bro made the bars
  too wide to stop anyone.
* that's, uh.
* your cue to laugh.
* or, uh, to emote
  at all...?
* (gee, lady, you really
  know how to pick
  'em, huh...?)
* OK, that's fine.
* everyone's got their
  own sense of humor.
* Human.
* Don't you know how
  to greet a new pal?
* Turn around and shake
  my hand.
* quick, behind that
  conveniently-shaped
  lamp.
* sup, bro?
* staring at this lamp.
* it's really cool.
* do you wanna look?
* hmm...
* maybe this lamp will
  help you.
* hey, take it easy.
* i've gotten a ton 
  of work done today.
* a skele-ton.
* come on.
* you're smiling.
* wow, sounds like
  you're really working
  yourself...
* down to the bone.
* ok, you can come out
  now.
* uh, ok, i guess you
  don't have to.
* yeah.
* that worked out, huh?
* you oughta get going.
* he might come back.
* and if he does...
* ... you'll have to
  sit through more of
  my hilarious jokes.
* what's the holdup?
* look, there's nothin
  to be afraid of.
* it's just a dark cavern
  filled with skeletons
  and horrible monsters.
* well?
* ... are you just gonna
  stare at me, or...?
* hey, here's something
  important to remember.
* my brother has a very
  special attack.
* if you see a blue
  attack, don't move and
  it won't hurt you.
* here's an easy way to
  keep it in mind.
* imagine a stop sign.
* when you see a stop
  sign, you stop, right?
* stop signs are red.
* so imagine a blue stop
  sign instead.
* simple, right?
* when fighting, think
  about blue stop signs.
* remember...
* blue stop signs.
* hey, thanks...
* my brother seems like
  he's having fun.
* by the way, did you
  see that weird outfit
  he's wearing?
* we made that a few
  weeks ago for a costume
  party.
* he hasn't worn anything
  else since...
* keeps calling it his
  "battle body."
* man.
* isn't my brother cool?
* it would make my
  brother happy if you
  played along.
* thanks for saying
  "junior jumble" just
  to appease my brother.
* yesterday he got
  stumped trying to
  "solve" the horoscope.
* papyrus...
* ... finds difficulty in
  interesting places.
* guess you don't like
  word searches, huh?
* me neither.
* i'm more of a funny
  pages kind of guy.
* i guess despite all
  that, you still like
  word searches, huh...?
* that means you can't
  be all bad.
* actually, that spaghetti
  from earlier...
* it wasn't too bad for
  my brother.
* since he started cooking
  lessons, he's been
  improving a lot.
* i bet if he keeps it
  up, next year he'll even
  make something edible.
* hey...
* puzzles might be fun.
* if you tried them.
* good job on solving it
  so quickly.
* you didn't even need
  my help.
* which is great, 'cause
  i love doing absolutely
  nothing.
* ... you must be really
  good at puzzles,
  huh?
* it's impossible for
  you to have seen
  this one before.
* hey, why didn't you
  ask for help?
* i was right here.
* what's up?
* you sure do like to
  exercise.
* i don't know what my
  brother's going to do
  now.
* if i were you, i would
  make sure i understand
  blue attacks.
* here, i'll give you some
  advice about fighting
  my brother.
